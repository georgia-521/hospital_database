This is a project from my undergraduate degree. The project was to set up a website with a cloud based database for any intended purpose we desired using AWS.
I chose to create a hospital database that allowed searching the patients name, the patients number or the patients condition.
It also allowed a doctor/healthcare provider to add their own data to the database.
The database was created via MariaDB inside AWS RDS.
Provided scripts reference localhost as XAMPP was used to test functionality originally.
